    Ozzy the Painter is a non-binary rapper, producer, and multi-instrumentalist
    from Minneapolis. Though they were born in St Paul, they've called many
    places home; they spent their childhood and early adolescence in Alaska, and
    finished high school and studied music in their mother's hometown in
    northern Sweden. After many years of nomadism, a long road trip, and a $300
    parking ticket, they spent a summer in Minneapolis and decided to set some
    roots in the twin cities once more.

    Ozzy's music touches on themes of travel, love, queerness, mental illness,
    radical politics, and their relationship to the quest for a place to belong.
    They've collaborated with Twin Cities artists Zeus James, Mariah Mercedes, Chase
    Vibe, and Endless Grudge, among others. They draw inspiration from
    many styles of contemporary hip-hop, including artists such as Saba,
    Noname, EarthGang, and JPEGMAFIA, as well as modern jazz/fusion artists like
    Anomalie, Kiefer, Snarky Puppy, and Shai Maestro. The result is a sound that
    embraces its grit and its fluidity in equal parts, and leaves an impression
    as complex as the world that gave rise to it.
