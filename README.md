# Svelte Website Rebuild

*Duration: Weekend project*

As a weekend challenge, I chose to do a quick rebuild of my artist website, while also diving into two new technologies that I was curious about: SvelteKit and Sass.

Notable features that I enjoyed learning:
- A markdown-based blog feature, utilizing mdsvex to parse markdown files into Svelte components
- Dynamic routes to display individual blog posts
- SCSS mixins to generate responsive font sizes based on preset breakpoints
- Using a ```{#key}``` block with Svelte transitions to create smooth loading transitions between pages

## Future Ideas
- Embedded music players
- Photo gallery
- Mailing list integration

## Built with
- SvelteKit
- Vite
- SCSS
- Luxon.js
- Mdsvex
- ESLint
